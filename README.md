## Project Description

This E-commerce project is a result of my commitment to building a robust online shopping platform. Using the Sanic framework for the backend, FaunaDB for the database, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, I aimed to create a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Project Development Story

The journey of developing this project has been both challenging and rewarding. Starting from conceptualization to implementation, every step has contributed to refining my skills as a developer. I focused on creating a user-friendly interface, optimizing backend processes, and ensuring data integrity through FaunaDB.

## Implemented Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Product catalog with detailed descriptions
- Cart management and checkout functionality
- Responsive design for various devices

## Challenges Faced

One of the most significant challenges encountered during development was integrating FaunaDB seamlessly with Sanic. Understanding the intricacies of a serverless database required careful consideration, but ultimately it provided a scalable and efficient solution for our e-commerce platform.
